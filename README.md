Redirector
================
This is a simple go app meant to redirect a request to its ssl counterpart.

Building
---------
You'll need `go` installed. I've used 1.62 which was the last release available.
In order to build with the make file, you'll also need `make` installed.

run `make` to build the program or `make run` to both build and run it.
Running
--------
The program will be located under the bin folder if you've used `make` to build/run it.
